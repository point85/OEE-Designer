<p>A cron expression is a string comprised of 6 or 7 fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the
allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as
follows:</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Field Name</th>
            <th>Mandatory</th>

            <th>Allowed Special Characters</th>

<p>So cron expressions can be as simple as this: <tt>* * * * ? *</tt></p>

<p>or more complex, like this: <tt>0/5 14,18,3-39,52 * ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010</tt></p>

<h2 id="special-characters">Special characters</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><tt><strong>*</strong></tt> (<em>"all values"</em>) - used to select all values within a field. For example, "<strong>*</strong>"
  in the minute field means <em>"every minute"</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt><strong>?</strong></tt> (<em>"no specific value"</em>) - useful when you need to specify something in one of the
  two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a
  particular day of the month (say, the 10th), but don’t care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put
  "10" in the day-of-month field, and "?" in the day-of-week field. See the examples below for clarification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt><strong>-</strong></tt> - used to specify ranges. For example, "10-12" in the hour field means <em>"the
  hours 10, 11 and 12"</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt><strong>,</strong></tt> - used to specify additional values. For example, "MON,WED,FRI" in the day-of-week
  field means <em>"the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday"</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt><strong>/</strong></tt> - used to specify increments. For example, "0/15" in the seconds field means <em>"the
  seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45"</em>. And "5/15" in the seconds field means <em>"the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50"</em>. You can
  also specify ‘/’ after the ‘<strong>’ character - in this case ‘</strong>’ is equivalent to having ‘0’ before the ‘/’. ‘1/3’
  in the day-of-month field means <em>"fire every 3 days starting on the first day of the month"</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt><strong>L</strong></tt> (<em>"last"</em>) - has different meaning in each of the two fields in which it is
  allowed. For example, the value "L" in the day-of-month field means <em>"the last day of the month"</em> - day
  31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the day-of-week field by itself, it simply means
  "7" or "SAT". But if used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means <em>"the last xxx day of the
  month"</em> - for example "6L" means <em>"the last friday of the month"</em>. You can also specify an offset
  from the last day of the month, such as "L-3" which would mean the third-to-last day of the calendar month.
  <em>When using the ‘L’ option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you’ll get
  confusing/unexpected results.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><tt><strong>W</strong></tt> (<em>"weekday"</em>) - used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day.
  As an example, if you were to specify "15W" as the value for the day-of-month field, the meaning is: <em>"the
  nearest weekday to the 15th of the month"</em>. So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th.
  If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on
  Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify "1W" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger
  will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not ‘jump’ over the boundary of a month’s days. The ‘W’ character can only
  be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
            The 'L' and 'W' characters can also be combined in the day-of-month field to yield 'LW', which
            translates to *"last weekday of the month"*.
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><tt><strong>#</strong></tt> - used to specify "the nth" XXX day of the month. For example, the value of "6#3"
  in the day-of-week field means <em>"the third Friday of the month"</em> (day 6 = Friday and "#3" = the 3rd one in
  the month). Other examples: "2#1" = the first Monday of the month and "4#5" = the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note
  that if you specify "#5" and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the month, then no firing will occur that
  month.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
            The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive. <tt>MON</tt>
            is the same as <tt>mon</tt>.
